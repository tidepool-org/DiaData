# DiaData

This is a generator for cgm and bgm values for Tidepool testing. This is not a diabetes data dimulator to be used for research purposes as the math being used here is not representative of any widely accepted simulator models. This data is currently saved in the Tidepool data model format.

## Running

Use `npm install`

Use `node simulateCGM.js` for cgm data only (basals and carbs being added currently)

use `node simulateSMBG.js` for smbg data only
